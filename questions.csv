What is the most difficult technical problem you have solved? How did you do it?,"In a project involving the Amazon API, we faced constraints that limited API requests to one call per second, posing significant delays when fetching data for up to 50 products simultaneously. To address this, I architected a more sophisticated solution using Redis for caching combined with a rate-limiting algorithm. First, I implemented Redis to cache data from frequent product queries, which drastically reduced the number of direct API calls. To optimize our handling of API limits, I designed a dynamic batching system that aggregated requests and prioritized them based on the time-sensitivity and frequency of the product data needed. This system used a sliding window rate limiter to ensure we stayed within API call rate limits without manual delays. Additionally, for products not in the cache or those needing real-time updates, I introduced a fallback mechanism that adjusted the frequency of API calls based on historical data access patterns, thereby distributing calls more evenly over time and reducing peak load. This multi-tiered approach not only conserved API usage and minimized response times but also maintained data freshness and accuracy, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of our data retrieval system."
